When embarking on a project, the need for data preparation varies with the feature in question. For instance, **Draft** may not require any pre-existing data if you're starting from scratch. Conversely, for features like **Translate**, it's crucial to format your dataset appropriately to ensure seamless translation processes.

## CSV
